The Lakeside Technology Center (350 East Cermak) is a 1.1 million square foot multi-tenant 
data center hub  owned by Digital Realty Trust. Originally developed by the R.R. Donnelley Co. 
to house the printing presses for the Yellow Book and Sears Catalog, 
350 East Cermak was converted to telecom use in 1999, and today it is one of the world’s largest 
carrier hotels and the nerve center for Chicago’s commodity markets, housing data centers for 
financial firms attracted by the wealth of peering and connectivity providers among the 70 tenants.

The industrial strength infrastructure includes four fiber vaults and three electric power feeds, which provide the building with more than 100 megawatts of power. 

One of the most distinctive features of the facility is its cooling system, which is supported by an 8.5 million gallon tank of a refrigerated brine-like liquid. The huge tank serves as thermal energy storage for the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority (MPEA), including the nearby McCormick Place Exposition Center and Hyatt Regency Hotel as well as 350 East Cermak. Thermal energy storage can reduce costs by running chillers during off-peak hours when power rates are cheaper.
